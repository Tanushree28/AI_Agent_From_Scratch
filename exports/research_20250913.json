  "summary": "In September 2025, Nepal experienced significant political unrest following a government-imposed social media ban aimed at suppressing dissent. This led to widespread protests, primarily driven by Generation Z, resulting in the resignation of Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli and the appointment of Sushila Karki as interim Prime Minister. The protests escalated into violence, with a rising death toll and destruction of government property, highlighting the fragility of democracy in Nepal.",
